                <p class='msg'>Hello, loves!</p>
                <p class='msg'>I'm a Boise-based photographer who specializes in natural light images. I've been doing this for about 4 years now, and have the wonderful privilege of being a self-taught photographer. I spent one semester at Boise State University, and was a member of the Blue Thunder Marching Band. I spent most of my free time practicing with my first camera, an 8 megapixel Canon Rebel XT. Being such a low resolution model (Think 24 as what we'll use today!) , I had to quickly learn how to get the best shot possible. It was the best teacher I could have imagined!</p>
                <p class='msg'>That's not all that I do, though. When not behind a lens, you can usually find me making homemade spaghetti, playing Dungeons and Dragons (#BARD), or sewing a cosplay for the local Anime convention.</p>
                <p class='msg'>My mission is to take the awkward feeling out of getting your picture taken. We all know that school-picture-day routine; getting all dressed up, knowing that you're probably going to hate the outcome no matter what. Getting those prints a few weeks later and cringing. That's never a fun experience.</p>
                <p class='msg'>So what should you expect with me?</p>
                <p class='msg'>Hopefully, at the very least, the OPPOSITE of that feeling. Getting your picture taken should be a beautiful expression of self love, appreciation, and respect for the wonderful human you've grown to be. When receiving your photos from Clay Captures Photography, I know you'll be overjoyed.</p>
                <p class='msg'>I'm so excited to meet you!</p>
                <p class='sig'>Xo,</p>
                <p class='sig'>Catherine</p>
